Here’s a three-sprint plan to get you to a v0.1 MVP—that end-to-end single-mission loop with basic UI and save/load—using 2-week sprints. Feel free to tweak durations or shuffle tasks as your team size and velocity dictate.

**Sprint 1 (Weeks 1–2): Foundation & Architecture**

* **Project setup**

  * Create Unity project, Git repo, folder structure (Scenes, Scripts, UI, Data)
  * Decide on UI framework (e.g. UI Toolkit vs. UGUI)
* **Core data & state machine**

  * Design data models (Mission, Captain, Ship, CrewMember, Route) as ScriptableObjects or plain C# classes
  * Implement a simple MissionStateMachine with states: Config → Setup → Play → End
* **Basic UI placeholders**

  * Stub out three scenes/screens:

    1. ConfigScreen (placeholder buttons)
    2. MissionScreen (blank canvas)
    3. EndScreen (“Mission Complete”)
* **Save/Load skeleton**

  * Choose serialization format (JSON or Unity’s built-in)
  * Write SaveManager with Save() and Load() methods that read/write a dummy GameState

**Deliverable:** Unity project that compiles, lets you switch between the three stub screens via the state machine, and writes/reads a dummy JSON file.

**Sprint 2 (Weeks 3–4): End-to-End Mission Loop**

* **Config phase**

  * Build UI for Captain selection (ScrollView of cards)
  * Ship selection dropdown/grid
  * Route picker UI
  * Hook UI → data models so chosen values populate a MissionData object
* **Setup & mission stub**

  * Transition to MissionScreen and display summary of MissionData
  * Kick off a placeholder “mission” loop (e.g., progress bar filling over 10 s)
* **State transitions**

  * Wire Confirm buttons to advance MissionStateMachine through Config → Setup → Play → End
* **Persist real data**

  * Serialize actual MissionData to SaveManager on End
  * Load MissionData back into ConfigScreen to demonstrate Load functionality
* **Quick QA & bugfixes**

**Deliverable:** Playable flow where you pick captain/ship/route, run a dummy mission, save the mission data, and on Reload see your previous choices.

**Sprint 3 (Weeks 5–6): UI Polish & Save/Load Refinement**

* **UI polish**

  * Replace placeholders with final UI layouts, art, fonts, and button styling
  * Add feedback (e.g. loading spinners, confirmation popups)
* **Robust save/load**

  * Handle edge cases (corrupt files, first-run no save)
  * Support multiple save slots if desired
* **Basic audio & VFX**

  * Wire in SFX for button clicks and mission complete
  * Simple transitions (fade in/out) between screens
* **Testing & documentation**

  * Write up run-through guide for QA
  * Fix show-stopper bugs
* **MVP build**

  * Create a standalone build with menu, player can start mission, save, quit, reload, and play again

**Deliverable:** A polished v0.1 build you can demo: full single-mission loop, working UI, and reliable save/load.
